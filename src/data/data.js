    "description": "India and Australia share general good relations, both countries bound by the same ethos of democracy and pluralism. Both countries were part of the British Empire and are currently members of the British Commonwealth. There are many commonalities such as the English language and the love for the game of cricket, which bring the people of both countries together. India Australia relations background Ties between India and Australia started right from the time when European settlement began in Australia. When New South Wales was founded as a penal colony, all trade with the colony was controlled by the British East India Company. Before the Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901, many migrant workers and labourers were taken from the Indian subcontinent to Australia Growing people-to-people ties There are many citizens in Australia with Indian origins. Out of the country’s 24 million people, about half a million are of Indian origin. The fastest-growing language in Australia is Punjabi. As of 2017, more than 60000 students from India are studying in Australia. More than 2 lakh Indians visit Australia every year. As of the year 2021, the bilateral trade between the two nations is worth A$25.9 billion Diplomatic Ties India established a Trade Office in Sydney in 1941. After independence, in 1950, Robert Menzies became the first Australian Prime Minister to visit India. He had earlier supported India’s admission into the Commonwealth as a republic. In 2009, a ‘Strategic Partnership’ was established between the two countries and relations have significantly expanded since then. In 2013, A K Antony became the first-ever Indian Defence Minister to visit Australia. The current PM Narendra Modi visited Australia in November 2014, a few months after he was appointed the PM. India – Australia Military Relations A joint naval exercise called AUSINDEX is carried out between India and Australia every year. Mr. Marles, on a four-day visit to India, said that India too has similar security concerns and that Australia stands in solidarity with New Delhi over its border row with China in eastern Ladakh. China is the \"biggest security anxiety\" for Australia as it is seeking to shape the world in a way that was not seen before India and Australia are working closely together to build our relationship economically but also in the context of defence so that together we are engaging more deeply to enhance the defence and security of both our nations Australia is in India’s extended neighbourhood. Both are strong, vibrant, secular and multicultural democracies. They also share political, economic, security, lingual and sporting ties. Before independence, Australia and India were both part of the British Empire. Both are members of the Commonwealth of Nations",

    "title" : "Ethical Hacking",
    "description": "We currently live in a digital age where almost everything is online and connected to the Internet. Keeping everything digitized certainly makes life a lot easier, but this concept comes with certain consequences. Hacking is one of the biggest shortcomings concerning computer technology. Ethical Hacking or penetration testing has come up as a profession to counter this. So, let’s answer the question, ‘What is Ethical Hacking?’ When we look at the news, there are frequent occurrences of cyber security threats, data leaks, money theft, digital attacks, and cyber espionage. All of this is enabled by the fact that people with malicious intent can now orchestrate these activities in the comfort of their homes, from behind a computer screen. With the widespread access to the Internet across the world, this convenience incentivizes an exponentially greater number of hackers to attempt cyber crimes. Naturally, this phenomenon has led to an increased demand for skilled Ethical Hackers and other Cybersecurity professionals. What is Ethical Hacking? When we talk about Ethical Hacking, it is explicitly implied that we are talking about hacking that is based on ethical or moral values, without any ill intent. Ethical Hacking is defined as any form of hacking that is authorized by the owner of the target system. It can also refer to the process of taking active security measures to defend systems from hackers with malicious intentions on data privacy. From a technical standpoint, Ethical Hacking is the process of bypassing or cracking security measures implemented by a system to find out vulnerabilities, data breaches, and potential threats. It is only deemed ethical if the regional or organizational cyber laws/rules are followed. This job is formally known as penetration testing. As the name suggests, this practice involves trying to infiltrate the system and documenting the steps involved in it.  To sum it up, an Ethical Hacker hacks the target system before any harmful hacker can. This allows the security team of the organization to apply a security patch in the system and effectively eliminate an opening for the attacker to enter the system or execute a hack. Types of Ethical Hacking Web Application hacking: Web hacking is the process of exploiting software over HTTP by exploiting the software’s visual chrome browser, meddling with the URI, or colluding with HTTP aspects not stored in the URI. System Hacking: Hacktivists gain access to personal computers over a network through system hacking. Password busting, privilege escalation, malicious software construction, and packet sniffing are the defensive measures that IT security experts can use to combat these threats. Web Server Hacking: An application software database server generates web information in real-time. So attackers use Gluing, ping deluge, port scan, sniffing attacks, and social engineering techniques to grab credentials, passcodes, and company information from the web application. Hacking Wireless networks: Because wireless networks use radio waves to transmit, a hacker can easily squirt the system from either a location nearby. To discover the Identifier and bodge a wireless network, often these assailants use network snorting. Social Engineering: The art of manipulating the masses so that they divulge sensitive information is known as social engineering. Eugenics is used by criminals since it is generally easier to attack your organic hard time trusting than it is to figure out how to spoof your device. Types of Hackers A hacker is a person who solves a technical issue by using a computer, networking, or even other abilities. Anyone who uses their skills to gain access to a system or network in application to break laws is referred to as a hacker. There are different types of hackers: 1. White Hat Hackers On the dark web, these are the right people who come to our aid. White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, are cybersecurity experts who assist the government and businesses by performing penetration testing and identifying security flaws. Ethical hackers use a variety of techniques to protect themselves from black hat hackers and other cybercriminals. They break into our system with the good intention of finding vulnerabilities and assisting you in removing viruses and malware. 2. Black Hat Hackers These days, black hat hackers are the main perpetrators of cybercrime. The majority of the time, the agenda of a black hat hacker is monetary. These hackers look for flaws in individual computers in businesses and banking systems. They can hack into your network and gain access to your personal, business, and financial information by exploiting any loopholes they find. 3. Grey Hat Hackers Grey Hat Hackers fall in between white and black hat hackers. Grey hat hackers may not use their skills for personal gain, they can however have both good and bad intentions. For instance, a hacker who hacks into an organization and finds some vulnerability may leak it over the internet or inform the organization about it. Nevertheless, as soon as hackers use their hacking skills for personal gain they become black hat hackers. Importance of Ethical Hacking Let’s understand why Ethical Hacking or penetration testing is such an important field. For this, we need to understand some of the many use cases and types of Ethical Hacking. Here are a few of them: Testing password strength Ensuring security settings and privilege levels in the domain account and database administration by testing out exploits Penetration testing after every software update/upgrade or after adding a new security patch Ensuring that data communication channels cannot be intercepted Testing validity of authentication protocols  Ensuring security features in applications, which protect organizational and user databases Defence against denial-of-service attacks Network security and testing of anti-intrusion features As you can see, the aforementioned tasks are important to protect the integrity of a digital lifestyle and work environment. If you do not hire Ethical Hackers to deter the threat of unethical hackers, then you are setting yourself up for disaster.  Let’s take a scenario that is very much based on real-world cases in the past. If you are running an e-commerce or social media website, you need to create databases for your web application to save the details of your customer accounts. These details and data can range from birthdays, addresses, and likenesses to private multimedia content, privileged messages, payment information, hashed passwords, etc. As you can probably figure out, any successful attack or exploit on your website, which leads to this data being leaked to an attacker or the public, can prove to be a huge problem. There would be legal repercussions from the customers who had entrusted you with their private data, which could lead to a hefty fine in court. After that, there would be a lack of trust in your website’s security, which would lead to drastically reduced traffic. All of this will be a big liability for your organization.  Based on the above case, you can probably understand the importance of Ethical Hacking Phases of Ethical Hacking There are multiple phases involved in any elaborate hacking process. Let’s go through them one by one.  Reconnaissance: Before executing any hack, you need to gather some preliminary information about the target system. This information could be about the people or organizations associated with the target, details about the host system, or the target network. The primary intention of this step is to engineer a hack based on the exact technology and security measures implemented by the target system. Scanning: Most of the time, hacking is done through network access. Most of our devices, whether in an organization or at home, are connected to a network. The common form of this network is Wi-Fi or WLAN. In offices, ethernet connections are also laid down to ensure maximum efficiency. As a hacker, you can take advantage of this factor and focus on gaining unauthorized access to the network of the target host. In this process, the network topology and vulnerable ports are revealed. Gaining Access: The two aforementioned steps complete the information gathering phase. Now, based on that information, you need to start your hack. This step involves breaking into the target system by cracking the password or bypassing the security measures. Maintaining access: After gaining access, you need to ensure that once you are done with your first session, you can retain access to the target system. This is done through a backdoor. A backdoor is an exploit or a hack that is left in the target system for future access. If you don’t leave a backdoor, the target system may implement a newer security patch or reset its security measures, and you may have to execute or craft the hack once again.  Clearing tracks: After finishing up with the attack or hack, it is important to remove the traces of your incursion. This step involves removing any backdoors, executables, or logs that may lead to the attack being traced back to you or found out in the first place.",

    "title" : "Old Age Home",
    "description": "There are various stages in human, life, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. We all have to come and journey across these ages. However, our behaviour, attitude, temperaments and physical fitness are different in every stage. Also, not to forget that man is a social animal. He or she cannot stay in isolation. He needs to live in a family, with his friends in society. The entire world works smoothly on interdependence. Love, affection, and care are mutual, and they help a person live and not merely exist.Due to the advent of urbanisation, modernisation and several other factors, the joint families have shattered. People are busy with their jobs, and they hardly have any time and interest to look after the older members of the family. Therefore, they leave their parents in old age homes. Also, many insensitive people, abandon their parents, and as a result of which various Non-governmental Organisations and governmental organisations rescue them and admit them to old age homes. Many people, who have no family to take care of, admit themselves to the old age home voluntarilyAn old age home is a shelter house where the people of older age dwell together with other older people when they have been abandoned by their family members or voluntarily admitted to it to combat loneliness during this crucial stage of life. The old-age house staff is in charge of feeding these senior citizens on time and taking care of their medical needs. They help them cope with the routine by cleaning their clothes and utensils and helping them live the last days of their life without isolation. Also, they conduct various recreational activities, to indulge them in and combat boring lifestyles. They entertain them so that they become happy and jolly. Also, the house inmates stay together, share their experiences and make good bonds with their friends. People are also adopting these new lifestyles and in a way, adjusting or compromising with life. However, it is important not to forget that we have to take care of the parents during their old age because they have taken care of us and raised us with a lot of love and affection since childhood. We should not be selfish and seek their blessings by providing them physical, social and emotional support. On the part of the parents, it is important to get prepared for the worst, in the case shortly and should not live with a lot of hopes, but make good savings to lead independent life during the old age, in case their children abandoned them, or any mishap occurs. We should make sure there should be no old age home at all. People should get all love, care, attention and support from their own family. In this way, we can become good human beings and seek their blessings.",
